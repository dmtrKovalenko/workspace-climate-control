# CO2nsole

Welcome to CO2nsole, an innovative open-source project aimed at providing an environmental monitoring device that measures CO2 levels and all the other microclimate information in a private open and efficient way. This repository contains all the resources necessary to build the CO2nsole device, as well as a CLI library for a Text-based User Interface (TUI) library, making it highly embeddable into other projects or targets.

## Features

- **DIY Build Guide**: Step-by-step instructions to build your own CO2nsole device.
- **CLI for TUI**: Intuitive command-line interface to interact with the device via a text-based user interface.
- **Embeddable Solutions**: Flexible design for integrating CO2nsole functionality into different target environments.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitor CO2 levels in real-time with accurate and responsive readings.
- **Open-Source**: Freedom to modify, enhance, and distribute the application as per your needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting with CO2nsole, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of electronics and Raspberry Pi (or any other compatible platform)
- Python 3.6 or newer
